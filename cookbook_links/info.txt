There are currently two cookbook links which will be picked up - "project_cookbook" and "workstation_cookbook".  These 
should be links to cookbooks such that there is a "pivotal_workstation" directory under each symbolic link.  EG:

/Users/pivotal/workspace/foo/chef/pivotal_workstation/(attributes|recipes|templates)
Should be linked using the command:
ln -s /Users/pivotal/workspace/foo/chef   ~/wschef/cookbook_links/project_cookbook

These cookbooks should define a "linked_project_recipe" and a "linked_workstation_recipe" which will be called by the 
default workstation.json.

The workstation cookbook overrides the project cookbook which overrides the wschef cookbook.
