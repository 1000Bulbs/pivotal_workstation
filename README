Things you'll need:
snow leopard
Git - Or get the files from github yourself
Xcode - the bootstrap script will install  bundler, which needs something which needs xcode



Core goals:

Decomposed / modular.  As much as is possible / makes sense, you should be able to pick and choose and mix and match recipes.
Unobtrusive.  As much as possible we want to allow development environments to be wide-ranging. (poorly said)

Getting Started:
Install Xcode from apple
Install git from google code: http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list?can=3
cd ~
git clone http://github.com/pivotalexperimental/wschef.git
cd wschef
ruby install_chef.rb
(edit project_workstation.json if desired)
./run
