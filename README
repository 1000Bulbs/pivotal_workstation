Things you'll need:
Snow Leopard - We make no effort to test on anything less
Git
Xcode



Core goals:

Decomposed / modular.  As much as is possible / makes sense, you should be able to pick and choose and mix and match recipes.
Unobtrusive.  As much as possible we want to allow development environments to easily mimic the project's production environment.
