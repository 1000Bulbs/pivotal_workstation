Things you'll need:
snow leopard
Git - Or get the files from github yourself
Xcode - the bootstrap script will install  bundler, which needs something which needs xcode



Core goals:

Decomposed / modular.  As much as is possible / makes sense, you should be able to pick and choose and mix and match recipes.
Unobtrusive.  As much as possible we want to allow development environments to be wide-ranging. (poorly said)
